# Next the trends of the stock is observed based on the daily returns i.e. daily percentage change in closing price of the stock. The trends are analyzed based on the following conditions :-
# <br> 1. If the daily returns are between -0.5 and 0.5 that means very slight change or no change
# <br> 2. If the daily returns are between 0.5 and 1 that means slight change on the positive side
# <br> 3. If the daily returns are between -1 and -0.5 that means slight change on the negative side
# <br> 4. If the daily returns are between 1 and 3 that means change on the positive side
# <br> 5. If the daily returns are between -3 and -1 that means change on the negative side

# The above plot is volatility vs time plot.
# <br> **Volatility** is the change in variance in the returns of the stock over a specific period of time. If the stock market falls or rises more than 1% over a sustained period of time it is called a volatile market. 
# <br> To analyze the volatility of a stock, a general trend of the market is needed. The **NIFTY 50** index is National Stock Exchange of India's benchmark broad based stock market index for the Indian equity market. NIFTY 50 stands for National Index Fifty, and represents the weighted average of 50 Indian company stocks in 17 sectors. NIFTY 50 provides the general trend of the stock market along which the volatility of a stock is analyzed. 
# <br> To calculate the Volatility : First the 7 day rolling average also called moving average of the daily returns is calculated using rolling function provided by the pandas library. Then the standard deviation of the whole is calculated. 
# <br> If a stock is volatile, it means it is riskier to invest in them but one can expect high returns from them.

# The above plot plots the 21 day moving average and 34 day moving average. The rolling mean of the closing price is calculated for 21 and 34 days respectively.

# The above plot is of Bollinger Bands. **Bollinger Bands** are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time.
# <br> It consists of 3 bands :- 1. **14 day rolling/moving average (green band)**
# <br> 2. **Upper Band (blue band)** - Calculated using the addition of 2 times the standard deviation of the 14 day rolling standard deviation from the 14 day rolling mean.
# <br> 3. **Lower Band (red band)** - Calculated using the subtraction of 2 times the standard deviation of the 14 day rolling standard deviation from the 14 day rolling mean.
# <br> If the 14 day rolling average is closer to upper band it indicates that the stock is **overbought** whereas if it closer to lower band it indicates that the stock is **oversold**.
